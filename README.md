[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/crossplatform-killport.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crossplatform-killport)

Command line program to kill the process running on a given port in any operating system.

Unlike many of the other programs out there that do this, this one works in Windows, Linux, and Mac, it is very easily installed in any OS using `npm` because it is written in Node.js, and it is actively maintained by a [team](https://rooseveltframework.org/contributors.html) of people rather than being just some guy's project from several years ago that may or may not work.
